# Blueprint: Readynotes Website

## Overview

This document outlines the design and development plan for Readynotes, a web application for organizing and viewing educational notes. The application will feature a modern, intuitive interface with notes categorized for easy access.

## Project Outline

### Design and Styling
*   **Layout:** A responsive, single-page application layout using a header and a main content area.
*   **Typography:** Use modern, readable fonts (e.g., from Google Fonts).
*   **Color Palette:** A clean and modern color scheme with a primary color for branding and accent colors for interactive elements.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Header:** Contains the application title and a styled menu toggle button.
    *   **Menu Bar:** A collapsible side menu with a "lifted" feel, created with a multi-layered drop shadow and a subtle background texture.
    *   **Category List:** A list of clickable categories with interactive hover effects.
    *   **Note Card:** A custom web component (`<note-card>`) to display individual notes with a title and content.

### Features
*   **Toggle Menu:** Users can show or hide the category menu with a stylish button.
*   **View Notes by Category:** Users can click on a category to see the notes associated with it.
*   **Dynamic Content:** Note and category data will be stored in JavaScript and dynamically rendered.
*   **Web Components:** The UI will be built using a `note-card` custom element for modularity and reusability.

## Current Plan

1.  **`style.css`:** Refine the styling of the side menu and the menu toggle button.
    *   Enhance the `#menu-toggle` button with a more interactive and modern look.
    *   Apply a multi-layered `box-shadow` and a subtle noise texture to the `#category-list` to give it a premium, tactile feel and a strong sense of depth.
    *   Improve the hover and active states of the category list items for better user feedback.
